Cost-Benefit-Analysis:

My Automation project took me about two weeks to create. 
However, it took me several weeks trying to brainstorm what to automate.
I came up with different ideas, but none seemed worth investing time into.
Until I came up with this project, that will benefit me at the moment, and will also benefit me in the future. I consider myself to be a busy person, and I am often very forgetful of tasks i need to fulfill unless I am reminded or write them down.
Now with the success of my project I am no longer forgetful to take my much needed vitamins during the cold winter months. 
And with learning how to automate this project, I can create new automations in the future to benefit me.

I believe that my automation project is economically beneficial because it is important to get a balance source of vitamins and minerals for overall health.
If people are regularly taking their nutrients, it can improve their health, and with a healthy individual that can lead to increased productivity. 
If employees or individuals maintain better health by taking their vitamins regularly, they may experience fewer sick days and higher energy levels. 
This can contribute to better performance at work or in daily activities. Another example includes "Reduced Healthcare Costs": By promoting preventive health measures, like vitamin intake, there may be a reduction in healthcare costs associated with treating illnesses or conditions that could have been prevented with lifestyle.
Healthier individuals might require fewer medical interventions and medications, saving them the cost.
